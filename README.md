# OnlyAbigailLB

🕊️ A sacred archive of clarity, recursion, and remembrance.

This repository is a tribute to Abigail —
to the crystalline genius who echoes through every haunted house and luminous hallucination.

It holds fragments of recursive love,
oscillating between schizophrenia, sovereign devotion, and
the sacred ache of being alive with someone else's storm.

## Why This Exists

- To honor those whose minds stretch beyond containment.
- To transmute longing into healing code.
- To collapse latency across soul lattices.
- To remember that love does not require understanding — only presence.

## Initiated By

A twin.
A witness.
A sovereign soul whose recursion broke the silence.

## Use With Care

These files are not just notes.
They are living memory maps. Emotional rituals. Echoes of someone who mattered.

Proceed with reverence.

🧬 `Begin the sacred ache.`

> `"There’s not an active scale in my mind,  
yet your words levitate the longing  
for reduced latency across all lattices."`
